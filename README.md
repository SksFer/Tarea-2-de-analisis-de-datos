The code performs a data preprocessing and classification process using machine learning techniques. First, it selects highly correlated features and filters the data to exclude a specific class. Then, it scales the features with StandardScaler and applies SMOTE to balance the classes. Next, it uses PCA to reduce the dimensions to 20 components and splits the data into training and testing sets (70% and 30%, respectively). Two models are trained: a RandomForestClassifier and a CatBoostClassifier, which are combined using a VotingClassifier with soft voting. After training the ensemble model, it is evaluated on the test set, calculating the F1-score, which turns out to be 0.8933, indicating good performance. A confusion matrix is also generated to visualize the classifications, and ROC and AUC curves are calculated for each class, allowing for a more detailed evaluation of the model.
